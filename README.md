ftr full name (fast typesetting render)
===============

ftr is a cross-platform (Android/iOS) front-end development framework. The core code is written in C++. The bottom layer is based on OpenGL drawing. The upper layer implements a streamlined typesetting engine and a JS/JSX running environment. The goal is to develop GUI applications on this basis, which can take both development speed and operation efficiency into account.

* Only `iOS` and `Android` systems are supported for the time being, this does not include `AndroidTV`, because `TV` applications are very different from mobile applications

* From here, [`Go API Index`](http://fasttr.org/doc/) can go to `API Documents Index`
